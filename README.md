# **Predicting taxi fare using multiple linear regression**
In this project, I built and evaluated a multiple linear regression model to predict the taxi fare for New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC). It is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. This helps them estimate taxi fares before the ride and aids in their regulatory process.

I have broken down the entire process into four stages: Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Evaluate (PACE). The actions performed under each stage are as follows:

- **Plan – Understanding the data within the problem/business context**
- **Analyze – Conducting exploratory data analysis, visualizations**
    - **Feature Engineering**
- **Construct – Building multiple regression model**
- **Evaluate – Interpreting the model results**
